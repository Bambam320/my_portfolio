  /*
  Welcome to hell, secretary! You've just started day one at the most unorganized company ever and it's your job to sort the schedules out.
  The bigwigs are trying to get together and find a profitable path forward but they need help scheduling their meetings. That's where you come in and 
  step one is to find all of the overbooked meetings.
  
  You are given a set of meeting start times and their planned durations. You have to figure out if there are any conflicts, and if there are, then keep track of
  the count of conflicts and the total time of conflicts. That's when the big bucks start rolling in, because the more conflicts there are, the more valuable you are to
  the company, or something, who knows.
  
  Let's get to work: A conflict consists of an overlap between two meetings. In the examples below, if there are any conflicts then the count of conflicts and the
  total time of overlapping meetings are returned in an array. 
  
  Ex. 1 ->
  The first meeting started at 8 o'clock in the morning and lasts for 45 minutes but another meeting is starting at 8:30 in the morning and will last for
  30 minutes.
  ```
  'RESULT', beepboop(['0800,45', '0830,30'])) // --> [1, 15]
  ```

  Ex. 2 ->
  There are no conflicts so return a reference phrase to 'Office Space' or any string other than 'error'. 
  Really, any phrase you like, and I'll give you a Clever upvote. Unless you use the 'OOO face' phrase, then you're getting a Best Practices upvote only.
  ```
  'RESULT', beepboop(['0800,30', '0930,45', '1145,60', '1245,45'])) // --> No problems today, better make sure those TPS reports are in order!
  ```

  Ex. 3 ->
  There are 3 conflicts for today's meetings so the correct result should include 3, for the meetings and the total over lapping time of 75 minutes.
  ```
  count = 1 // --> meeting[0] conflicts with meeting[1]
  overlap = 30 // --> all of meeting[0] overlaps with meeting[1]
  count = 2 // --> meeting[0] conflicts with meeting[2]
  overlap = 45 // --> the last 15 minutes of meeting[0] overlaps the first 15 minutes of meeting[2]
  count = 3 // --> meeting[1] conflicts with meeting[2]
  overlap = 75 // --> the last 30 minutes of meeting[1] overlaps all of meeting[2]
  'RESULT', beepboop(['0800,30', '0800,45', '0815,45'])) // --> [3, 75]
  ```

  Ex. 4 ->
  If one of the rules are broken then return 'error'.
  ```
  'RESULT', beepboop(['2515,43', '1230,45', '1030,115', '1100,43'])) // error
  ```
  
  RULES:
  1. All input meeting start times are formatted in military time.
  2. All input meeting durations are in minutes AND will never be less than 1 minute or greater than 120 minutes.
  3. Input array contains string elements consisting of [(meeting start time), (meeting duration)].
  4. Input array will only contain meetings for todays work day, from 8am to 6pm, no overtime at this awesome company. They probably allow WFH and have like a 4 day work week because YEAH!!
  5. Two overlapping meetings will count as a single conflict.
  6. Meeting start and end times do not overlap as shown in example No. 2.
